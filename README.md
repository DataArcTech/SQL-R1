## 📖 Overview

Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) enables intuitive interactions with databases by transforming natural language queries into structured SQL statements.  Despite recent advancements in enhancing human-computer interaction within database applications, significant challenges persist, particularly regarding the inference performance in complex scenarios involving multi-table joins and nested queries. Current methodologies primarily utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the NL2SQL model, which may limit adaptability and interpretability in new environments (e.g., finance and healthcare). In order to enhance the reasoning performance of the NL2SQL model in the above complex situations, we introduce SQL-R1, a novel NL2SQL reasoning model trained by the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. We design a specialized RL-based reward function tailored for NL2SQL tasks and discussed the impact of cold start on the effectiveness of intensive training. In addition, we achieve competitive accuracy using only a tiny amount of synthetic NL2SQL data for augmented training and further explore data engineering for RL. In existing experiments, SQL-R1 achieves execution accuracy of 88.6\% and 67.1\% on the benchmark Spider and BIRD, respectively.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

> [!NOTE]
> Before getting started, make sure your computing environment supports the following settings:
> - Environment: Python 3.9+
> - CUDA Version: 12.0+ (for verl and vllm integration)
> - GPU Prerequisites: 8 x 80GB+ GPU (for training) / 2 x 40GB GPU (for inference)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MPX0222/SQL-R1.git
cd SQL-R1
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
conda create -n sqlr1 python=3.9
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install vllm==0.6.3 ray
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install -e .  # For verl integration
pip install wandb IPython matplotlib sqlparse func_timeout
```

4. Download the model weights from HuggingFace and put them in the `models/` directory. 

5. For training, copy the training dataset in the `example_data` directory to the `data` directory. For inference, copy the database information in the `db_info` directory (including files forSpider-dev, Spider-test and BIRD-dev) to the related dataset (`data/Spider`, `data/BIRD`) directory.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Run training:
```bash
sh sh/train.sh
```

2. Run inference:
```bash
sh sh/inference.sh
```

3. Run evaluation:
```bash
# evaluate spider
sh sh/eval_spider.sh
# evaluate bird
sh sh/eval_bird.sh
```
